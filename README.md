# How To Compile and Run
Once everything is installed and you have cloned the repository, open the project files in Qt Creator which you should have installed. From there you will be able to compile our code. 

To compile, select the "Build" option on the top of your menu bar. Then select to build this project. To check if it compiled there will be a green status bar on the bottom right of Qt Creator. Once it is fully green, you will know that it compiled correctly. From there you can go ahead and run the program. 

In order to run, head back to the "Build" option and this time you will select "Run". A screen shoud appear that will allow you to input many different values.

If you are unable to run the project, do not hesitate to contact me.

# Options

Once you run the program, there should be a window that allows you to input the width and height of the image

Then, you are allowed to select the rows and columns of each layer. *Note*: you cannot make them greater than the width and the height. If you do not wish to select your own values there is a random selection button you may use that will store values randomly for you. *Note*: there is also a reset button that clears everything.

Once you are happy will your inputs, you can go ahead and select create image
